# Cplusplus-Program

# Summary
The goal for this project was to develop a basic clock app that would display a 24-hour and 12-hour clock. What I think I was done well in this project was splitting
up the project into functions to reduce clutter and practice modularity. If I was to go back to this project in the future to improve it I would add classes so I could make it 
more secure and even more modular. A challenge in this project was taking the time from the user's computer and turning it into a string to display it in a correct format. 
During this project I became more comfortable using functions and searching through library documents to find existing functions. Because each task was given it's own function it 
made this project easy to debug, read, and in the future to make adaptations.

Thanks for reading!
